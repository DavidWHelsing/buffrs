## Integrations

Having a standalone distribution system and package manager for protocol
buffers is the first step towards solving [the
problem that engineers are facing](../guide/why-buffrs-exists.md).

Ensuring a _works out of the box_ experience through integrating into common
build systems is the next one.

We are providing integrations for the following build systems at the moment:

* [Cargo](./cargo.md)

If you are missing your favorite build system, please create an issue on GitHub
to request it â€“ or ideally help us by building or researching parts the
integration!
